# Data Science/ Data Analytic Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._


- ### Machine Learning
	- __Python__
		- [Data Analysis of credit risk using Machine Learning models](https://github.com/janetcheung-byte/portfolio/tree/master/machine_learning): Data analysis of loans by machine learning models. Resampling and Ensembke Learning are the techniques used I used to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques from imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries.


	_Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Imblearn

- ### SQL
	- __Python, SQL__
		- [Data Analysis of credit card transactions](https://github.com/janetcheung-byte/sql_data_analysis/blob/master/data_analysis.ipynb): Analyze historical credit card transactions and consumption patterns in order to identify possible fraudulent transactions.

	_Tools: Postgres SQL, Pandas, Numpy_

 - ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- __Python__
		- [Visual Analysis of real estate market prices](https://github.com/janetcheung-byte/data_visualization): This dashboard presents a visual analysis of historical prices of house units, sale price per square foot and gross rent in San Francisco, California from 2010 to 2016. 

		
	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib_

 - ### Time Series Forecasting model 
	- __Python__
		- [Time Series Forecasting model](https://github.com/janetcheung-byte/a_yen_for_the_future): Built a time series forecasting model in Python to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar
